- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JuliaAllen1
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating a website that gives people a much easier time learning languages! (And also career opportunities)
- As far as CS goes, I'm learning networking, Git/Github, JS, website design, and the like. Otherwise, I'm learning 4 languages (Japanese, Finnish, Latin, and German)!
- ðŸ“« I can be reached at the phone number (803)-381-1827, at my email, jeremiahallen062607@gmail.com, or my organization email, 00020936@richland2.org.
